Shockwave Flash ObjectAxShockwaveFlashObjectsIn order to play the Flash movie in your VB.NET application, please add the unmanaged Shockwave Flash component as COM reference in your project and use Shockwave control added in the Toolbox. The following steps shows you the way:1. In Solution Explore, right click References and choose Add Reference. In COM tab, add Shockwave Flash. I am using Windows XP, the TypeLib Version is 1.0, the path is C:\WINDOWS\system32\Macromed\Flash\. The file name is Flash9d.ocx. 2. Right click Toolbox -> Click "Choose Items", in COM Components tab, choose Shockwave Flash Object, then you can see the control in the Toolbox.3. Drag and drop the Shockwave control on the form, you will get "Failed to import the ActiveX control. Please ensure it is properly registered." error message. Click OK. 4. Right click the project name in Solution Explorer, choose "Rebuild". When the project rebuild succesfully, you are able to add the Shockwave control on the form this time.I tried this, the steps work well on my computer in VB 2005 Express Edition.Hope that helps.//OtherI have run the PowerShell as administrator, and executed both of these commands:c:\windows\system32\regsvr32.exe c:\windows\syswow64\macromed\flash\flash10e.ocxc:\windows\syswow64\regsvr32.exe c:\windows\syswow64\macromed\flash\flash10e.ocxWent to My Project --> Compile --> Advanced Compile Options... and changed Target CPU from "Any CPU" to "x86" (effectively making my app 32-bit).//Flash Call: flashPlayer.CallFunction("<invoke" +           " name=\"loadAndPlayVideo\" returntype=\"xml\">          <arguments><string>" + fileDialog.FileName +           "</string></arguments></invoke>"); axShockwaveFlash1.SetVariable("mc_mytext.text", "Hello Flash, greetings from .NET");
