To run .NET applications with XP you must at least    Set the project type to x86 (not Any CPU).    Target .NET framework 4.0 or lower (4.5 does not work with XP but is the default with VS 2012).    Ensure that the XP system on which the application is installed has the corresponding .NET framework installedThe first two settings are VisualStudio project settings.For the third it might be necssary to include the framework redistributable with your installer.
