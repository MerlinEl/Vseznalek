Maybe a Windows driver problem. Do your uno and nano use a ch340? (It is the component translating USB to uart (serial pins of atmega328). Windows has no software way to differenciate boards using this component. It is a common use on cheap clones to lower price. Official arduinos use a second atmega (atmega16u2 natively supporting usb) instead of the ch340. Allowing windows to identify the arduino model.You should try to update your ch340 driver as you have the same problem with the 2 boards. here is the download page of the manufacturer (ch341ser.exe is the package you want)http://www.wch.cn/download/CH341SER_EXE.html
