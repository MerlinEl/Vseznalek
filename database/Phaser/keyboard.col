For anyone who finds this thread in a search (like me) while trying to enable key captures for DOM elements outside of your Phaser game, you can use this.input.keyboard.enableGlobalCapture() (Keyboard plugin docs 11).This does not disable Phaser from capturing the keyboard, so if you want to disable input in Phaser while enabling input elsewhere, you can do something like:this.input.keyboard.enabled = false;this.input.keyboard.enableGlobalCapture();and this.input.keyboard.disableGlobalCapture(); to re-disable global capture.Apologies if this post necromancy bothers anyone, just wanted to add this here for anyone else who finds this via Google search :]//disable Phaser keyboard        document.onkeydown = function (e) {            return false;        }
