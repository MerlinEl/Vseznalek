in Phaser 2 can be done with this  var logo = game.add.sprite(game.world.centerX, game.world.centerY, 'phaser');    logo.anchor.setTo(0.5, 0.5);    var blurX = game.add.filter('BlurX');    var blurY = game.add.filter('BlurY');    logo.filters = [blurX, blurY];but how about Phaser 3?There's a camera blur shader I believe.You would need to add a camera which ignores all objects except those you want blurred.Rex has a blur plugin. I've used it before. Same idea.
