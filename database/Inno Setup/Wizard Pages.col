Users may proceed to the next page only if the option "I accept the agreement" is selected.    Password    Shown if Password is set. Users may proceed to the next page only after entering the correct password.    Information    Shown if InfoBeforeFile is set.    User Information    Shown if UserInfoPage is set to yes.    Select Destination Location    Shown if DisableDirPage is set to no or auto.    Select Components    Shown if there are any [Components] entries.    Select Start Menu Folder    Shown if there are any [Icons] entries and if DisableProgramGroupPage is set to no or auto.    Select Tasks    Shown if there are any [Tasks] entries, unless the [Tasks] entries are all tied to components that were not selected on the Select Components page.    Ready to Install    Shown by default, but can be disabled via DisableReadyPage.    Preparing to Install    Normally, Setup will never stop or pause on this page. The only time it will is if Setup determines it can't continue or if it detects applications using files that need to be updated.    The former can happen if the PrepareToInstall event function returned an error or if one or more files specified in the [Files] and [InstallDelete] sections were queued (by some other installation) to be replaced or deleted on the next restart. In this case, it tells the user they need to restart their computer and then run Setup again. Note that this check is performed on silent installations too, but any messages are displayed in a message box instead of inside a wizard page.    The latter can happen if CloseApplications is set to yes or force.    Installing    Shown during the actual installation process.    Information    Shown if InfoAfterFile is set.    Setup Completed    Shown by default, but can be disabled in some cases via DisableFinishedPage.See the AllPagesExample.iss example script for an example which shows all these pages.
