So you wanted to use DestDir: "{code:GetInstallDirs}"?The DestDir can point to a single folder only.You have to create more entries in [Files] section, if you need to install the same file to multiple folders. Note that Inno Setup will compile the source file only once to the installer.I'm not aware of an easy way to create the multiple entries programmatically.You could create "a lot" of entries likes:[Files]Source: "myfolder*"; DestDir: "{code:GetInstallDirs|1}"; Check HasInstallDir(1)Source: "myfolder*"; DestDir: "{code:GetInstallDirs|2}"; Check HasInstallDir(2)Source: "myfolder*"; DestDir: "{code:GetInstallDirs|3}"; Check HasInstallDir(3)...You can create a large list of such entries using Inno Setup preprocessor.#define EntryI#sub AddEntrySource: "myfolder*"; DestDir: "{code:GetInstallDirs|{#EntryI}}"; \    Check: HasInstallDir({#EntryI})#endsub #for {EntryI = 1; EntryI <= 100; EntryI++} AddEntry
