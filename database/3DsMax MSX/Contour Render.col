ontour rendering is curently not supported with the new Unified Sampling default in 3dsMax 2014. Perhaps you are using that ? Switching to another sampling mode should bring it back.Note: Contour shading does not work with distributed bucket rendering.ProceduresTo add contours to a mental ray rendering:Choose Customize  Preferences. Go to the mental ray panel, and turn on Enable Mental Ray Extensions.On the main toolbar, click  (Render Setup).If mental ray is not already the active renderer, go to the Common panel, and on the Assign Renderer rollout, click the “...” (Choose Renderer) button for the Production renderer. The Choose Renderer dialog opens. Highlight “mental ray Renderer” in the list, and then click OK.Leave the Render Setup dialog open, or minimize it. Open the Material Editor. For the materials of objects you want to render with contours, use the mental ray Connection rollout to assign a shader to the Contour component.Another technique would be to use the mental ray material, and assign shaders to both the Surface and Contour components.Tip: The Simple contour shader renders uniform lines whose color and width you can control. The other contour shaders provide variant contour styles with more direct user controls.On the Render Setup dialog, go to the Renderer panel. On the Camera Effects rollout, turn on Enable in the Contours group.To simply add contour lines to a rendering, leave the shaders in the Camera Effects rollout set to their defaults. For other options, see Camera Effects Rollout (mental ray Renderer) .
