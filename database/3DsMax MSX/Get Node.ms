There’s two methods… this one has existed for a long time:   myHandle = $.inode.handle -- returns a node handle, integer   myNode = maxOps.getNodeByHandle myHandle -- returns the node given the handle   But if you plan on doing any merging, x-ref’ing, etc. this method is unsafe, as the handle changes.And this one is ‘new’ and applies to non-nodes as well (materials, controllers, etc.)   myHandle = getHandleByAnim $   myNode = getAnimByHandle myHandle
