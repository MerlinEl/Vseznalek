Here is how I do it with a 32bit Targa file. To see the transparency of a 32bit TGA file in the viewport and have it render correctly here's what I do:1. Make a TGA material and assign the TGA to the DIFFUSE slot2. Double-click and open DIFFUSE slot in material editor3. Uncheck "tile" in the Coordinates section of the TGA properties of the DIFFUSE Targa material (sometimes needed to view transparency in viewports, sometimes not).4. Check ALPHA in the Mono Channel Output area5. Go back to the maps section in the material editor6. Drag the DIFFUSE slot contents to the OPACITY slot and choose INSTANCE for the copy method7. Make sure you right-click on the active viewport label and choose TRANSPARENCY - BEST to see your results in the viewportThat should get it. I have no idea why unchecking tile in the coordinates section allows you to sometimes see the transparency in the viewport, but it works for me. Hope this is of some help.
