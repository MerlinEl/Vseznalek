So, basically, after the modifications via Photoshop I opened "jpg" file in Adobe Illustrator (it is possible to open .psd files directly), and made a path there:Object>Image Trace>MakeObject>Image Trace>ExpandDelete picture frame anchor points.Choose Colors (right panel), Swap Fill and Stroke (left panel).Then I saved as .ai file (Illustrator 8 version is fine for 3dsMax 2009), finally, imported into 3dsMax (File>Import...), and have their that shape.
