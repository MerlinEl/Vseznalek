When you open a file in notepad++ it will attempt to load syntax highlighting for the contents based on file extension.If you use a custom extension for one of the existing languages you can add the custom extension in Settings -> Style Configurator. Select language and add the extension in the "User extension" edit box. To add multiple extensions separate them using Space.You then need to re-open your file to see the syntax highlighting applied.You can also change syntax highlighting style by selecting a different language from the language menu.// ORIn case one is using Notepad++ session files (I named them *.nppxml) you could edit them and change the <File lang="..."> attribute, e.g.<File ... lang="Normal Text" ... filename="httpd.conf"<File ... lang="Normal Text" ... filename="some.log"to:<File ... lang="Powershell" ... filename="httpd.conf"<File ... lang="log" ... filename="some.log"to get nice default (or user-defined as in my case with *.log files) syntax highlighting immediately without reopening each single file etc..
