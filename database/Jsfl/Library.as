Bitmaps can mess up a Library pretty quickly, so you’ll begin by wrangling those.1. Open an existing document with an unorganized Library, or create a new document and add some Library items to test the script on.2. Create a new JSFL script (File > New > Flash JavaScript File).3. Add the following variables to your script so that they can be easily reference in the rest of your code:var dom = fl.getDocumentDOM();var lib = dom.library;var items = lib.items;4. Add a folderName variable after the previous variables :var folderName = "bitmaps";5. Add the following line to check for the existence of the folder, and to create the folder if it doesn’t exist after the code in the previous steps:if( ! lib.itemExists(folderName) ) lib.newFolder(folderName);The exclamation point (!) inverts the truth value (i.e. to see that the item does not exist). Technically, the if statement is unnecessary, since the new folder will only be created if the path doesn’t already exist, but it’s a good practice to have the check, in case the functionality changes in a future version of Flash, or you want to update the script later to act differently if the folder has already been created.6. Add the following code to loop through the library items and move only the bitmaps to the “bitmaps” folder:for(var i=0; i<lib.items.length; i++){var o = lib.items[i];if(o.itemType=="bitmap") lib.moveToFolder(folderName, o.name);}When run on the Library shown above, the results appear as follows:You can use the same logic to create and organize folders for any of the available item types.Organizing Multiple Item TypesNow that the bitmaps are under control, why not take care of some other items? Follow the steps below to create and organize several folders.1. Add a new array to the existing set of variables and create several new items based the folder names you want to appear in your Library:var dom = fl.getDocumentDOM();var lib = dom.library;var items = lib.items;var folderTypes = new Array();folderTypes['bitmaps'] = "bitmap";folderTypes['mcs'] = "movie clip";folderTypes['graphics'] = "graphic";folderTypes['audio'] = "sound";folderTypes['fonts'] = "font";Each new type should be assigned a value that matches the name of an itemType.2. Then start a for in loop that encompasses the previous for loop the folderTypes that you’ve created:for(var type in folderTypes) {if(!lib.itemExists(folderName)) lib.newFolder(folderName);for(var i=0; i<lib.items.length; i++){var o = lib.items[i];if(o.itemType=="bitmap") lib.moveToFolder(folderName, o.name);}}3. Add folderName and itemType variables inside the for in loop to store information from the folderTypes array:for(var type in folderTypes) {var folderName = type;var itemType = folderTypes[folderName];4. Alter the hard-coded “bitmap” itemType to reference the itemType variable, so that it will update as the for in loop runs:if(o.itemType==itemType) lib.moveToFolder(folderName, o.name);
