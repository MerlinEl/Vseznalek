1. What is OCX?OCX refers to COM components developed in C++, C# or VB. The open interface can be used to call html to solve the problem of html calling local computer resources or third-party integration. Application scenarios include banking, video playback (using flash can also solve related problems), etc.2. What is the difference between OCX and COM and the difference between components developed by C++, C# and VB?For the components called by HTML, there is no difference between OCX and COM. Development with C++ and VB can generate OCX or COM components, but C# can only generate COM components.C# is a product of Microsoft, so the COM components it generates can only be used by IE at present;OCX also supports IE, but non-IE kernels can also be developed for use;3. What projects need to be selected for C# development of COM components?For windows development, developing COM is essentially developing DLL. C# development is basically using Virual Studio (I use VS2008, .NET version is 3.5), and you can select a class library for new projects.4. After the development, how to provide the open interface for HTML use?To enable the DLL to be the COM component in the program, you need to add [assembly: Guid("151e5c23-d121-4f26-a035-7a43f6d775b0") to the AssemblyInfo.cs (Android development colleagues can understand it as AndroidManifest.xml in Android). )], which means this project is open to COM, GUID is used for type library;Implement the IObjectSafety interface in the open interface class (the implementation code does not need to be changed, it is the same on the Internet, just take it directly);Finally, add a custom GUID outside your open interface class. This is the most critical step. [GuidAttribute("1A585C4D-3371-48dc-AF8A-AFFECC1B0967")], this GUID needs to be generated by yourself, and the HTML developer is installing After the COM component you provide, you need to know your GUID to use the interface you provide normally;Load the COM component in HTML first (note: here is not concerned with OCX or COM in HTML, the calling method is the same), <objectid="YouOcx"classid="clsid:FD05F7D5-BA6A-4d6a-9F79-DFADB79BA2B0"></object>, the classid here is the GUID you use to develop the COM component, and then you can use the object in the html, varocx = document.getElementById("YouOcx");ocx.XXX();, where XXX() is the method provided by your COM for HTML calls.
