I have a Visual C# application.  I have embedded a flash swf file into my project as an embedded resource.My swf file is called MyFlash.swf.If I do the following I can see that my file is embedded:           Assembly a = Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly();            string[] resources = a.GetManifestResourceNames();            foreach (string resourceName in resources)            {                MessageBox.Show(resourceName);            }My flash file is embedded as "MyForm.MyFlash.swf"Now I wish to set this embedded flash file as the movie to a ShockWave Flash Object I have placed on my form.e.g. axShockwaveFlash1.Movie = "MyForm.MyFlash.swf"How do I do this???If it was a bit map I would do something like:Stream stream = a.GetManifestResourceStream(selectedResourceName);Bitmap bmp = Bitmap.FromStream(stream);pictureBox1.Image = bmp;ResourceManager.GetObject doesn't work if you have just set the build action to "Embedded Resource". You need to use a stream:System.Reflection.Assembly thisExe;thisExe = System.Reflection.Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly();System.IO.Stream file = thisExe.GetManifestResourceStream("Namespace.Filename");byte[] data = new byte[file.Length];file.Read(data, 0, bytes.Length);Instead of setting the build action, you can open your Properties/Resources.resx and add the file. You can then access directly the resource with:byte[] data = Properties.Resources.Filename;Louis.fr you are the man!I added my swf file as a resource in the Resources.resx file.then I did the following:byte [] data = Properties.Resources.MyswfFile;InitFlashMovie(axShockwaveFlash1, data);The InitFlashMovie function I got from the link I posted above. thanks very much for your help.  This has helped me enormously! Also thanks to everyone else as well.
