Download CCleaner/Clean Master app from play store and clean up junk from your device regularly.(Do not use the auto-kill feature of Clean Master)After about 6 months or so clear system cache of your phone(The procedure varies from device to device so google up on how to)Download the app called Greenify from the Play Store and hibernate apps which you use very rarely or the ones which have a constant habit of unnecessarily restarting in background.(Clean Master app reports that this app has restarted this many number of times and is slowing down your device)Do not ever use any battery saver or task killer app ever.They just reduce your system performance by using extra CPU cycles. Detailed explanation here : Why You ShouldnÂ’t Use a Task Killer On AndroidClean up your home screen,use as little widgets as possible.Uninstall/disable unused applications.Turn off or reduce animations. And here's how to : Go to Settings > About phone and scroll down to the System section to look for Build number. Tap on it seven times and you should see a message about being a developer. You can now go back to the previous menu and you should see Developer options listed under System. Head in there and scroll down to find Window animation scale,Transition animation scale, and Animator duration scale. Tap each in turn and set it to .5x or off.You can try a third party launcher especially if you are using a Samsung device. Nova launcher is the best out there in the store,acc to me.And lastly,try a factory reset.And if all of these fails,try rooting your device and using a custom ROM.Google up on how to root your device and see if reputated developers like Cyanogen (company) has roms for your phones. Read reviews carefully and bugs of the rom. Using a non tested ROM is a great risk if you are not tech savy.Here is what Rooting (Android OS) is all about and Custom ROMs For Android Explained - Here Is Why You Want Them.Hope this helps!! :)https://www.quora.com/topic/Cyanogen-companyhttp://www.androidpolice.com/2010/05/01/custom-roms-for-android-explained-and-why-you-want-them/
