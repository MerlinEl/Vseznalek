How to: Root http://www.htcdesireforum.com/htc-desire-how-to/%28guide%29-rootin-flashing-rom/How do I root?Follow these steps EXACTLY! While it is significantly easier than traditional methods, do remember that they are not as simple as I make it to be and each step must be followed to the letter. TO THE LETTER!!! Failure to follow instructions will brick your phone, ok?1. Install the latest version of HTCSync.2. Uninstall HTC Sync, but leave the drivers on. Your Start menu should have HTC. As an additional note, uninstall everything that can and will sync the phone with the computer (like doubletwist) to be safe. REBOOT your PC.3. Set-up the HBOOT drivers by following the instructions as provided. I'd post a summary here, but they got everything down pat, including screenshots. Disconnect your phone after that.4. Go to unrevoked.com, download the latest (Version 3.21 at time of press) unrEVOked one click root, and wait...5. Do the following in the phone first.5a. “Settings” > “Application” > “Development” > Check “USB Debugging”5b. “Settings” > “Connect to PC” > “Default connection type” > “Disk Drive”5c. “Settings” > “Connect to PC” > un-check “Ask me”6. Run the unrEVOked package, and it will prompt you to plug your phone in USB debug mode. BEFORE connecting, in the “File” menu, un-check “Disable Security on Phone”.7. Plug the phone in and follow the on-screen instructions.8. Phone will re-start at least twice, and the whole process will take less than 30 minutes.9. Failure to follow instructions to the letter will BRICK your phone. Yes, I am serious. HTCSync.http://www.htc.com/www/supportdownloadlist.aspx?p_id=312&act=sd&cat=allHBOOT http://unrevoked.com/rootwiki/doku.php/public/windows_hboot_driver_installhttp://unrevoked.com/
