Yes, applying Filters or color effects on any Movieclip requires Cache as Bitmap to be applied to the Symbols in CreateJS. This causes such Movieclips to become static. If there is some animation inside such a Movieclip, you'll need to update the cache at every frame to play the animation correctly along with the desired filter/color effect.You can add a code snippet like this inside such Movieclips:if(!this.executed) {    this.on("tick", function() {if(this.cacheID)this.updateCache();});    this.executed = true;}PS: It does have a performance impact so avoid this for heavy usages.
