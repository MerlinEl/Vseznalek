Windows:C:\Program Files\Common Files\Adobe\Help\en_US\AS3LCR\Flash_10.0\index.htmlor"%COMMONPROGRAMFILES%\Adobe\Help\LANGUAGE\AS3LCR\index.html"To access the local copy of Flash CS4 help and the language reference, just tell Flash to “keep you offline”:Go to Window > Extensions > Connections. In the panel that pops up, click the arrow at the top-right and select “Offline options”. From there you can check the box for “Keep me offline”. Flash will then always default to using the offline help.I should note that doing this may also prevent you from using any other panels which call out to the internet, such as Kuler and the Flash startup/new file screen. As of now I'm not using any Internet-connected panels and I have the splash screen set to not show on startup, so this works quite well for me.
