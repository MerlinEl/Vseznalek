This answer is for when the winding is unknown. As the question is now phrased, simply calculating the edge normal directly is entirely sufficient and trivial.So, say you are trying to find the normal for edge AB. Take the normal (AB.y, -AB.x). Now dot this normal with the vector AC. If the result is positive, then the normal is facing towards the "inner" half-space, so invert the normal.ex:A = (3,4)B = (2,1)C = (1,3)AB = (2,1) - (3,4) = (-1,-3)AC = (1,3) - (3,4) = (-2,-1)N = n(AB) = (-3,1)D = dot(N,AC) = 6 + -1 = 5since D > 0:  N = -N = (3,-1)You could also use the "2D cross product" (treat each vector as if it were a 3D vector with a Z component of zero) between AB and AC, test if the resulting Z component were positive or negative, and then take the RHS or LHS normal respectively of AB. I find the dot product approach to be simpler.
