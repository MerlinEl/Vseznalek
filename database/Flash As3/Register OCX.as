Shockwave Flash not in COM list AND no OCX to register manuallyerrors “The referenced component ‘AxShockwaveFlashObjects’ and ‘ShockwaveFlashObjects’ could not be found” and “Type ‘AxShockwaveFlashObjects.AxShockwaveFlash’ is not defined.”I may have to manually register Flash using the DllRegisterServer (see this page). I installed flashplayer_11_ax_debug (2013).exeThe installation went fine, Flash works in Firefox (I have not tested IE), and now I have Flash64_11_9_900_117.ocx in C:\Windows\System32\Macromed\Flash, and Flash32_11_9_900_117.ocx in C:\Windows\SysWOW64\Macromed\Flash.There was no need to manually register the OCX file either. When I opened my VB project in visual studio, the compile errors I reported in my first post had disappeared. The Flash control was not in the toolbox, but by on the "Choose Toolbox Items" dialog (Right-click Toolbox & "select Chose Items..."), under the COM Components tab, I can once again see Shockwave Flash Object pointing to path C:\Windows\System32\Macromed\Flash\Flash32_11_9_900_117.ocx. So I have been able to add this object to the toolbox and drag it unto the Windows Form.
