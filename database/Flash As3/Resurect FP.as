According to Andkon Arcade, the last version of the plug-in that doesn’t include the killswitch is 32.0.0.371.Adobe Flash Player 32.0.0.371 – latest version without lockout/timebombIn 2020, Adobe has decommissioned its Flash Player old versions archive and announced that starting on January 12th, 2021, all Flash Player plugins after an unspecified version would refuse to run any Flash content inside a web browser, locking off a lot of outdated websites and historical digital art. Later, it was found out that the latest version without said lockout was 32.0.0.371, provided in this archive for Windows, macOS and Linux. The versions suffixed with “pep” are PPAPI (WebKit and Blink), the ones with “ax” are ActiveX (Trident and EdgeHTML) and the ones without suffix are NPAPI (Gecko). One can theoretically stay safe using Flash by exerting good judgment and setting one’s browser up to enable click-to-run. Be wise and enjoy the ride.Thanks to the /f/ anons and to foof23 on e621 for bringing this to light.This makes it work for me in MPC-HC:C:\Windows\SysWOW64\Macromed\Flash\mms.cfgAutoUpdateDisable=1EOLUninstallDisable=1SilentAutoUpdateEnable=0DisableDeviceFontEnumeration=1AllowListPreview=1TraceOutputEcho=1EnableAllowList=1EnableInsecureAllowListLocalPathMatching=1AllowListRootMovieOnly=1AllowListUrlPattern=file:*Note: Requires Windows 7 and Flash 32.0.0.465. It does not work on Windows 10 which uses Flash 32.0.0.445 (this version seems to be buggy as it also failed on Win7).Alternatively you can use RunAsDate (https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/run_as_date.html) tool on MPC-HC to fool the Flash plugin with a fake date.
