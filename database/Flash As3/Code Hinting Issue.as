Code hinting only works on an AS file when it is properly associated with an opened AS3 Flash file.Also please try out the following steps to increase the code hint cache size and then clearing the Code Hint cache as mentioned in above post.Windows:Open Regedit and navigate to: HKEY_CURRENT_USER > Software > Adobe > Flash 12 > SettingsRight+click and choose: ‘New… > DWORD Value’Rename the key: Project File CapSelect the key and choose: ‘Modify’Edit the value (put say: 2000)Click OK and restart Flash-----OR-----Hi ,I was able to repro the issue when I copied the AIR 3.3 SDK in the <Adobe Flash installed directory> in the same place where AIR 3.2 SDK is present. Code hinting stopped working for AIR 3.3. We are investigating this issue.You can try this workaround for now:1. Copy the AIR 3.3 SDK to some other location say "Desktop".2. Go to Help->Manage AIR SDK and delete the AIR 3.3 SDK added.3. Click on "+" again in the Manage AIR SDK dialog and add the AIR 3.3 SDK from the new location i.e where its copied in step 1 eg : c:\Users\<sudeshna>\Desktop\AIR 3.32. Quit Flash and Relaunch.3. Create a new AIR project and set the Target in Publish settings as AIR 3.3.0.3560 for Desktop and then try writing code in the actions panel.Let me know if this solves your problem.Thanks and regards,Sudeshna SarkarAdobe Flash Professional Team.
