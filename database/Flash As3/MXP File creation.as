http://download.macromedia.com/pub/d...ile_format.pdfThat is the link to the api on how to create an extension in mxp format.This is a rough overview of the process. Basically you create an xml file that looks like this.<macromedia-extension name = "Electric Panel Background" version = "1.0.0" type = "ActionScript" requires-restart ="false" ><description><![CDATA[Use this panel as a background]]></description><ui-access><![CDATA[This is the UI Access]]></ui-access><author name = "Eran Kriegshauser" /><products><product name = "Flash" version = "5" primary ="true" required ="true" /></products><files><file source = "panelBckdLp.swf" destination = "$flash/ElectricExtensions" platform="win" /></files></macromedia-extension>You then save it as a .mxi file type. Then double click on it and the Extension Manager will ask you what file you want to convert to .mxp format. Once you select it the EM will ask you what name you want the new .mxp filename to be called.The trick is learning the API in the .pdf to describe the Extension properly.There is a wizard out there called MXI wizard but it has not been updated for Flash MX. www.linecraft.comHope this helps.MXI file is a Macromedia Extension Information. It is a simple XML file that includes name and version information about your component, compatible/required products, descriptions, etc.
