Uploading video from iPad to server with AIR for iOSIn this part 2 post following on from Record and play back video with AIR for iOS on iPad I will show you how to take your freshly recorded video and upload it to a web server using PHP.Assuming you have a MovieClip or some other button labeled ‘uploadbtn’ you first need to add a click event handler to it to trigger the upload.uploadbtn.addEventListener(MouseEvent.CLICK, onUpload);Now for the click handler:function onUpload(e:MouseEvent):void{    // create a URLRequest for the PHP file on you server (we'll get to the PHP later)    var URLrequest:URLRequest = new URLRequest("http://www.yourdomain.com/uploadFile.php");       // videoFile is a File object we created in the last post which references the recorded video    // attach the various listeners for errors, progress, complete    videoFile.addEventListener(DataEvent.UPLOAD_COMPLETE_DATA, uploadDataComplete);    videoFile.addEventListener(ProgressEvent.PROGRESS, progressHandler);    videoFile.addEventListener(IOErrorEvent.IO_ERROR, handleError);    videoFile.addEventListener(Event.COMPLETE, completeHandler);       // call upload on the File object and pass in the URLRequest    videoFile.upload(URLrequest);}Now we can create the handlers for the attached listeners:function progressHandler(e:ProgressEvent):void{    // just tracing the percentage of progress - you could show it in a progress bar    trace("Uploading... " + Math.ceil(100 * (e.bytesLoaded / e.bytesTotal)) + "%");}function completeHandler(e:Event):void{    // upload process is complete    trace(videoFile.name + " has been uploaded.\n");}function uploadDataComplete(e:DataEvent):void{    //everything is complete, trace the message returned from the PHP script which is in XML format    var xml:XML = new XML(e.data);       trace(xml.message);}function handleError(e:IOErrorEvent):void{    // simple error handler traces the error    trace("Upload Error:" + e.text);}That is all that is required for the ActionScript side of things. Now for the PHP script. This is a very basic script and you should provide some security and validation on any production code.All you need to do is save this into a blank PHP file and upload it to your server to the location matching the address in you URLRequest above.<?php// variable for return message$message = "";// the directory to place the video relative to this PHP script$directory = "uploads/";// get the number of files already in the directory and increment the number for the new one// video from the iPad is always .MOV format$fileCount = count (glob ($directory."*.MOV"));$newName = $directory."video" . ( $fileCount + 1) . ".MOV";// move uploaded file with new name into directory specified aboveif (move_uploaded_file($_FILES["Filedata"]["tmp_name"], $newName)){    // create a successful message if all went ok    $message =  "<result><status>OK</status><message>$file_name uploaded successfully.</message></result>";}else{    // create a failed message if something went wrong    $message =  "<result><status>FAIL</status><message>$file_name did not upload successfully.</message></result>";}echo $message;?>That is all that’s required to upload a video from the iPad to a web server. It is surprisingly simple for how hard it was for me to work out.I hope this helps somebody out!
