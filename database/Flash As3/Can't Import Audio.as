---------------------ISSUE:---------------------Cn't import audio mp3 in to FLash---------------------SUGESTIONS:---------------------Make sure the MP3 is 16 bit, and not 24 or 32. Also, being 44.1 KHz would help, but it's the fact that they are 32 bit that stops them from importing.I had this issue when saving out of SoundBooth CS4.  There was a box in the Preferences>MetaData> "Include source XMP on save as"  this prevented Flash from opening the file... When I turned off the check box, MP3 and WAV files suddely worked.I had the same problem. But, i used adobe media encoder and reconvert it to mp3 then import it to library and every thing became fine---------------------SOLUTION---------------------Mp3 files must have bitrate 44100 Hz1) update audacity to version 3.0.2 (version before always recorder at bitrate 48000)2) if you want fix audio which are recorded at 48k bitrate use online converter https://www.aconvert.com/audio/because Audacity converter wont works :-(
