--list all loaded plugins for i=1 to pluginManager.pluginDllCount do (	format "name:% size:% dir:%\n" (pluginManager.pluginDllName i) (pluginManager.pluginDllSize i) (pluginManager.pluginDllDirectory i))Manager.Load/Unload assemblyAh, interesting that you discovered that :) Generally in .NET it isn't possible to unload an assembly from an AppDomain. But Manager.Unload will release it nevertheless and let you load another version on top of the previous one as long as the assembly version revision number differs.Marsel Khadiyev (Software Developer, EPHERE Inc.)
