Go to the Compiler Options tab and find the SWC Include Libraries section under Advanced.Click the browse (“…”) button and enter the path to the airglobal.swc which for me is in my Flash install directory C:\Program Files (x86)\Adobe\Adobe Flash CS6\AIR3.4\frameworks\libs\air\airglobal.swcthen click OK, then Apply and then click OK to close the Project Properties box.
