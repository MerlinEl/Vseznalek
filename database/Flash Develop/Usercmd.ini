Also you can still run em_Test2 and em_Test3 alone.You can execute UDC "em_name" (and cm_commands) by an Alias command (an shorter name as the "em_maybe_long_name") in TCs command line:wincmd.ini[Alias]TEST=em_which_maybe_have_an_longer_NameType 'test' in TC command line to execute the UDC with the Name "em_which_maybe_have_an_longer_Name"Next you can use Alias commands placeholder %A (or %A1...%A9) in an UDC, to modify the command on the fly.TC will support you by providing Parameters to pass current Files, FileS or FolderS, Target path and more to an external script or application.Open the help, search for "Button" to find "Dialog box: Configuration - Change button bar"(((Or click "Operations > Menus > Menu: Configuration > Change Button Bar > Configuration - Change button bar.")))There you can find parameters to pass to the other application, like%P > the source path to be inserted into the command line, including a backslash (\) at the end.%N > places the filename under the cursor into the command line.%T > inserts the current target path.%S > insert the names of all selected files into the command line.%L, %F and more > create a list file with the names of the selected files and directories.
