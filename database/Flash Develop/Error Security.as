The flash player will not allow accessing local files unless you permit it to do so. That being said...When you load the SWF locally and see the error appear, close the error display (so you're looking at your blank SWF right now)Right click in the swf and select "Global Settings"(this is with FP 10.3.183.7 - I believe it's 'settings' in previous players, previous players this would take you to your local settings manager that looked like it was a webpage)A dialog panel should show up named : Flash Player Settings ManagerClick on the 'Advanced' tab:Near the bottom you should see 'Developer Tools' :"Specify trusted locations for developer testing"Click on the "Trusted Location Settings" buttonYou should see the 'Trusted Location Settings' window.Click the 'Add' buttonProceed to add the file or folder (I usually add the folder of the project, so if I'm loading other resources in the project, it would accept that too)Hit Close, close the settings manager and...Refresh the page. The new security settings should allow you to access local files.Here's the tech note for more reference:http://help.adobe.com/en_US/FlashPlayer/LSM/WS6aa5ec234ff3f285139dc56112e3786b68c-7ff0.html#WS6aa5ec234ff3f285139dc56112e3786b68c-7febHope it helps anyone else out there.
