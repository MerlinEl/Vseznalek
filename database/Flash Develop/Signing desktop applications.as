Signing desktop applications with the AIR SDKIf you prefer working with command line tools, then you can use the ADT command line tool from the AIR SDK to generate the certificate and sign your application.If you don't have a certificate from a CA and you want to use a self-signed certificate, you can create one using ADT. Here is an example, which you can execute at the command line in a Console or Terminal window:adt -certificate -cn YourNameOrCompanyOrAnythingYouWant 1024-RSA certificate_name.p12 certificate_passwordFor the â€“cn parameter you should set your name or company name. Don't forget the password you set (in this example, it is certificate_password). You will need it later. After executing this command you should have a certificate named certificate_name.p12 in the directory in which you executed the command. (You can specify an absolute path together with the certificate name if you want to create the file in a different folder.)When you are ready to package and sign your application, you can use the following command:adt -package -storetype pkcs12 -keystore PATH_TO_YOUR_CERTIFICATE/certificate_name.p12 -storepass certificate_password YOUR_APPLICATION_NAME.air YOUR_APPLICATION_NAME-app.xml YOUR_APPLICATION_NAME.swfNote that in the command above that you have to specify at least:    the name of the AIR file that will be created    the name of the application descriptor file    the name of the SWF file
