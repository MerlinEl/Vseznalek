Hi the gm showed me the Lineage II source code, and I saw the enchant rate factors in the programming loop. I'm not sure if you're familiar with if-else statements in programming, but usually it looked something like this:if (player.location(toi13) && real.time(10CEST) && player.dwarf(female) && player.ArmorEquiptment(FormalWear)){     rng(100)// 100% ENCHANT RATE!!!!!!!!!!!!!}else if (weapon > 3){     rng(75) // Basically calls an RNG function to determine whether the weapon broke, not important. This is a 75% chance its giving to the function.}else{    cout << "ERROR 5524, now exiting!";    exit(1);} You have the best enchant rate playing a female dwarf in formal wear in toi 13 at 10-00 CEST right before the server restarts.I see some people have already found out the secret. They making tons of $$$ now!
