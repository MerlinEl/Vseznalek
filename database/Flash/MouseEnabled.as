MouseEnabled “not working” in flash as3. SolvedSpent half the night fighting that issue, I wanted to disable mouse clicks for TextFields on my gui HUD panel. So that I could click units beneath those text fields.tf.mouseEnabled = false;//didnt work for me as well astf_parent.mouseEnabled = false;//andtf_parent.mouseChildren = false;the problem was that the panel sprite (parent of text fields) was intercepting mouse clicks..The receipt:– use this code to monitor who’s receiving the clickimport flash.utils.getQualifiedClassName;stage.addEventListener(MouseEvent.CLICK, onClick);function onClick(event:MouseEvent):void{trace(“clicktarget: “, event.target.name, getQualifiedClassName(event.target));}– andtf.mouseEnabled = false;tf_parent.mouseEnabled = false;//and remove the hitArea for parent!!!!tf_parent.hitArea = new Sprite();tf_parent.hitArea.mouseEnabled = false;Hope this helps somebody!
