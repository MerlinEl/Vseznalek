A little too late ;) but another one with no loop and using bit masking operation :ret & -2 will make your number even, then depending on the result of (Math.random() >= evenProbability) you set the lower bit to be 1 to give an odd numberfunction randomRange(low:int, high:int, evenProbability:Number = 0.5):int{     var ret:int = int( Math.random() * ( 1 + high - low ) ) + low     return ( ret & -2 ) | int( Math.random() >= evenProbability )}
