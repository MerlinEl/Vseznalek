The target version of the player must be higher than the one you've got - Flash Player 9. As seen by the reference, it's said that Vector3D is included in: Runtime Versions: Flash Player 10, AIR 1.5. So basically you are building for so old Flash Player, that it still doesn't have this class inside it.Simply change the target version to the latest possible one, and be sure it's higher than Flash Player 10. That will do the job! :)
