You might not have a connection to the network, or the server itself may have a problem"."alternative timestamp services"https://timestamp.geotrust.com/tsa  404 -- Page Not Foundtimestamp.geotrust.com  "DOWN" //http://crl.geotrust.com/crls/secureca.crl0   //https://timestamp.geotrust.com/http://timestamp.entrust.net/TSS/JavaHttpTShttp://tsa.starfieldtech.com/http://timestamp.comodoca.com/http://time.certum.pl/"adobe flash air unable timestamp""SOLUTIONS:"./adt -package -storetype pkcs12 -keystore CERTIFICATE.p12 -tsa "http://sha256timestamp.ws.symantec.com/sha256/timestamp" -target air YOUR_APP.air YOUR_APP.airiThanks a lot, that fixed it for me! On Windows 7 with 32-bit Flash Builder and 32-bit Java SDK (jdk1.8.0_112)SOLVED: The error message appears when you have previously installations of the AIR app on your computer. You have to go under add/remove programs and remove each instance of your AIR app and then you'll be able to install the files. Wow, did I waste a lot of time on that!!"When publishing an AIR application, Flash Professional cannot access time stamp server"When a developer’s workstation is accessing the Internet through a proxy, Flash Professional can have problems accessing the time stamp server to create AIR applications. For Flash Professional CS5 and Flash Professional CD5.5, this can be fixed by editing Flash Professional’s JVM configuration file. The configuration file is at [install location]/Common/First Run/ActionScript 3.0/jvm.ini. Within this file add the following line:-java.net.useSystemProxies=true"Ok finally managed to make it work on Flash Builder 64bit on windows 10"1- install Java JDK 1.82- Copy the jre folder inside the sdk and replace the jre folder with the copied one inside flash builder installation folder3- Add this line without the quote "-Djava.util.Arrays.useLegacyMergeSort=true" in the flashbuilder.ini file in the installation directory of flash builderNow work like a charm to sign application directly in Flash Builder"research only:"Error creating native installer file: Could not generate timestamp: Connection timed out: connect.I’ve looked into this and it looks like you still need to manually copy the SDK’s airglobal.swc file("c:\Program Files (x86)\Adobe\Adobe Flash CS6\AIRSDK\23.0.0.257\frameworks\libs\air\airglobal.swc")in to Flash Pro CS6’s Common/Configuration/ActionScript 3.0/AIR3.1/ folder. ("c:\Program Files (x86)\Adobe\Adobe Flash CS6\Common\Configuration\ActionScript 3.0\AIR3.4\airglobal.swc")This may be a bug with CS6 as having to do this negates the Manage AIR SDK panel’s usefulness.You can find out more regarding the AIR overlay process in Flash CS6 from this Adobe resource: http://helpx.adobe.com/x-productkb/multi/overlay-air-sdk-flash-professional1.htmlIs there a fix for this on Flash CS6 > https://forums.adobe.com/message/9051357#9051357I've updated my version of Java,java version "1.8.0_111"Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_111-b14)Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.111-b14, mixed mode)restarted Flash but I still get the same problem.Do I need to copy one of the Java JAR files somewhere in with the CS6 installation ?Note. I do have CC2015.2 but I also need to run CS6 on Windows for legacy file format support with contractors."Problem in Deploying AIR Application"As a short-term workaround, you can specify "-tsa none" on the ADT command line. (If you are using Flash Pro or Builder, there should be an option in the UI). -tsa none disables timestamps.A timestamp requires an internet connection in order to get a signed timestamp token from a server. This is used to verify that your certificate was valid when the app was signed. Without a timestamp, your app won't be installable after your code signing certificate expires. With a timestamp, your app installer will not expire.Proxy connections are sometimes the issue. Since ADT is a Java program, you have to configure the Java proxy settings if this is the source of the trouble."Could not generate timestamp: Connection refused: connect".time-stamp the digital signatureYou can get different signing options from Adobe AIR * ADT code signing optionshttp://help.adobe.com/en_US/air/build/WS5b3ccc516d4fbf351e63e3d118666ade46-7f72.htmlRecently I am getting a "Can't access timestamp server" error message when compiling from CS6Při připojování k serveru razítek se vyskytla chyba.
