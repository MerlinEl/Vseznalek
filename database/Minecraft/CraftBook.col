• Book Reading:Just right click a bookshelf. It will load from a craftbook-books.txt file. You may edit that fileand add your own lines or replace it altogether. Each "book" goes on its own line. The file can beas big as you want it to be -- CraftBook never loads the entire thing into memory.• Gate Toggle:Make a wall sign near a fence gate with the second line as [Gate]. To toggle the gate, just rightclick the sign.• Elevator:Make it easy to go from level to level with this nifty elevator. Just make a sign with the second line as [Lift Up] or [Lift Down] and right click it to move between levels. Note that there must be a sign directly above or below the sign you right click on (depending on which way you want to go) in order for the elevator to work. Use [Lift] on the second line of a sign if you just need a placeholder for that purpose. The first line of the sign can be used to say the floor name (it willbe printed to chat).• Area Light Switch:This will toggle on the lights in the area on/off (about 10 units away, 5 units up/down). Just makea wall sign with the second line as [|] and have a torch above the sign.• Apple Trees:  Every time you destroy leaves, you may get an apple dropped for you to pick up. This chance can beadjusted inside craftbook.properties (the file is created when you first run CraftBook). Use a number between 0 and 100, with 100 being a 100% chance.• Bookshelf Drops:Every time you destroy a bookshelf, you will get a bookshelf item.
