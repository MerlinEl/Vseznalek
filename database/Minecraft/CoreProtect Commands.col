Type the command again to disable it. You can also use just "/co i".| /co rollback u:<user> t:<time> r:<radius> a:<action> b:<blocks> e:<exclude>Nearly all of the parameters are optional. Shortcut: "/co rb".Quote:u:<user> - Specify a user to rollback.Example: u:NotchQuote:t:<time> - Specify the amount of time to rollbackYou can specify weeks,days,hours,minutes, and seconds.Example: t:2w,5d,7h,2m,10sYou can pick and choose time amounts.Example: t:5d2hYou can also use decimalsExample: t:2.50h (2 and a half hours)Quote:r:<radius> - Specify a radius.You can use this to only rollback blocks near you.You can specify a number (e.g. r:5), a world (e.g. r:#world_the_end), a global rollback (r:#global), or a WorldEdit selection (r:#worldedit or r:#we)For example, the following would only rollback damage within 10 blocks of where you are standing: r:10Quote:a:<action> - Restrict the lookup to a certain actionFor example, if you wanted to only rollback blocks placed, you would use a:+blockHere's a list of all the actions:    a:block (blocks placed/broken)    a:+block (blocks placed)    a:-block (blocks broken)    a:click (player interactions)    a:container (items taken from or put in chests, etc.)    a:+container (items put in chests, etc.)    a:-container (items taken from chests, etc.)    a:kill (mobs/animals killed)    a:chat (messages sent in chat)    a:command (commands used)    a:session (player logins/logouts)    a:+session (player logins)    a:-session (player logouts)    a:username (username changes)Quote:b:<blocks> - Restrict the rollback to certain block types.For example, if you wanted to only rollback stone, you would use b:1You can specify multiple items, such as b:1,5,7You can find a list of block type IDs at http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Data_valuesQuote:e:<exclude> - Exclude certain block types from the rollback.For example, if you don't want TNT to come back during a rollback, you would type e:46Quote:#<hashtag> - Add a hashtag to the end of your command to perform additional actions.For example, to perform a rollback preview, you would use #previewHere's a list of available hashtags:    #preview (Preview a rollback/restore)    #count (Return the number of rows found in a lookup query)    #verbose (Display additional information during a rollback/restore)    #silent (Display minimal information during a rollback/restore)| /co restore u:<user> t:<time> r:<radius> a:<action> b:<blocks> e:<exclude>Same parameters as /rollback. Shortcut: "/co rs".Restoring can be used to undo rollbacks.| /co lookup u:<user> t:<time> r:<radius> a:<action> b:<blocks> e:<exclude>Same parameters as /rollback. Shortcut: "/co l".Lookups can be used to search through block data.| /co purge t:<time>Purge old block data. Useful for freeing up space on your HDD if you don't need the older data.For example, "/co purge t:30d" will delete all data older than one month, and only keep the last 30 days of data.If used in-game, only data older than 30 days can be purged. If used from the console, only data older than 24 hours can be purged.Example Rollback Commands:>>By default, if no radius is specified, a radius of 10 will be applied, restricting the rollback to within 10 blocks of you. Use "r:#global" to do a global rollback.Rollback Notch 1 hour (with default radius of 10):/co rollback u:Notch t:1hPREVIEW rolling back Notch 1 hour (with default radius of 10):/co rollback u:Notch t:1h #previewRollback Notch 23 hours and 17 minutes (with default radius of 10):/co rollback u:Notch t:23h17mRollback ONLY stone placed/broken by Notch within the last hour (with default radius of 10):/co rollback u:Notch t:1h b:1Rollback ONLY stone BROKEN by Notch within the last hour (with default radius of 10):/co rollback u:Notch t:1h b:1 a:-blockRollback EVERYTHING Notch did in the last hour EXCEPT for stone he placed/broken:/co rollback u:Notch t:1h r:#global e:1Rollback griefing Notch did in the last hour that is within 20 blocks of you:/co rollback u:Notch t:1h r:20Rollback griefing Notch did in the last hour ONLY in the Nether:/co rollback u:Notch t:1h r:#netherRollback everything done in the last 15 minutes by anyone within 30 blocks of you:/co rollback t:15m r:30Rollback everything done in the last 15 minutes in a WorldEdit selection:/co rollback t:15m r:#worldeditExample Lookup Commands:>>Lookup commands are generally the same as rollback commands. The primary difference is that a default radius is not applied to lookups, meaning all lookup commands do a global search by default.Lookup all diamond ore mined in the last hour:/co lookup b:56 t:1h a:-blockLookup all chat messages sent by Notch in the last 30 minutes:/co lookup u:Notch t:30m a:chatLookup all logins ever done by Notch:/co lookup u:Notch a:loginLookup all logins ever done by Notch:/co lookup u:Notch a:loginLookup previous usernames used by the Notch:/co lookup u:Notch a:username
