Hi JinSan,The .dll is xJSFL's biggest secret...You know why?It's a cheat!I discovered early on in development that some of the other plugins, when written to from JSFL would retain values for the entire session.I did some research on how to create my own .dll but it was beyond my reach, so in a flash of insight, I copied and renamed the Macromedia example tool star.dll (I think) to xjsfl.dll......and it just worked!So, no magic, just smoke and mirrors ðŸ˜œI've never seen the internals, and have no idea what is in there!
