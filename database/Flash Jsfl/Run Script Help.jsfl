The most common ways are explained in this section.TO RUN A SCRIPT THAT YOU ARE CURRENTLY VIEWING OR EDITING:Right-click (Command-click on the Macintosh) and choose Run Script.Click the Run Script icon on the Script window toolbar.This option lets you run a script before you have saved it. This option also lets you run a script even if no FLA files are open.TO RUN A SCRIPT THAT IS IN THE COMMANDS FOLDER, DO ONE OF THE FOLLOWING:From the authoring environment, select Commands > Script Name.Use a keyboard shortcut that you have assigned to the script. To assign a keyboard shortcut, use Edit > Keyboard Shortcuts and select Drawing Menu Commands from the Commands pop-up menu. Expand the Commands node in the menu tree to view a list of available scripts.TO RUN A COMMAND SCRIPT THAT IS NOT IN THE COMMANDS FOLDER, DO ONE OF THE FOLLOWING:From the authoring environment, select Commands > Run Command, and then select the script to run.From within a script, use the fl.runScript() command.From the file system, double-click the script file.TO ADD A TOOL IMPLEMENTED IN A JSFL FILE TO THE TOOLS PANEL:Copy the JSFL file for the tool and any other associated files to the Tools folder (see "Saving JSFL files").If tool is not visible in toolbar, click three dots (Edit Toolbarâ€¦)Add the tool to the list of available tools.You can add individual JavaScript API commands to ActionScript files by using the MMExecute() function, which is documented in the ActionScript 3.0 Language and Components Reference.

Even if called from ActionScript, JavaScript API commands have no effect in Flash Player or outside the authoring environment.TO ISSUE A COMMAND FROM AN ACTIONSCRIPT SCRIPT:Use the following syntax (you can concatenate several commands into one string):MMExecute(Javascript command string);You can also run a script from the command line.TO RUN A SCRIPT FROM THE COMMAND LINE ON WINDOWS:Use the following syntax (add path information as required):"Animate.exe" myTestFile.jsfl [-AlwaysRunJSFL]Use the -AlwaysRunJSFL option to bypass the dialog box that prompts you to confirm script execution.TO RUN A SCRIPT FROM THE "TERMINAL" APPLICATION ON THE MACINTOSH, USE EITHER OF THE FOLLOWING:Use the following osacript syntax (add path information as required):osascript -e 'tell application "Animate" to open alias "Mac OS X:Users:user:myTestFile.jsfl" 'The osascript command can also run AppleScript in a file.
