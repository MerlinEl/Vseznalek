If we can't get the graphics card to behave itself through the registry, we may have to adjust the settings in the interface. Let's try this:Go to NVIDIA Control Panel (right click on an empty space on your desktop. It should be one of the options in the menu) --> Manage 3D Settings --> Global Settings, and switch "Power Management Mode" to "Prefer Maximum Performance."Let's see if that does the trick. I will be digging in to other options, just in case.
