Win+P shortcut for choosing how to use the extra monitorShortcut to turning off 1 monitor in dual set upI have written a simple .bat file that should toggle your second monitor for you.This is what is in it:@echo offtitle ScreenOffclsfor /f %%A in (SreenOff.Dat) do set power=%%Aecho %power%if "%power%"=="ECHO is on." (set power=on)else (if "%power%"=="nope" (echo Switching ONDisplaySwitch.exe /extendset power=on)else (echo Switching OFFDisplaySwitch.exe /internalset power=nope))(echo %power%)> SreenOff.DatI have also attached the file, and by the way you can set a key shortcut to the executable in its properties.
