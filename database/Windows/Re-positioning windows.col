How can I stop windows re-positioning after waking from sleep?I'll just chip in my experience on the subject. Also had various problems with resized windows collecting on one screen. Frustrating and time consuming bug I would call it.As, many has mentioned here it looks like it's related to how fast the monitors comes out of standby and Windows rather crappy detection method of how many display currently attached.My config:Thinkpad T450s docked.Internal Screen (1920x1080) active + 2 Lenovo P27q-10 (2560x1440) on Displayport.After reading through this thread I tested just on solution but took it one step further after the first test.First attempt:Renamed (I understand that you can also delete the key) the registry key HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\GraphicsDrivers\Configuration and did a reset of the graphic subsystem SHIFT+CTRL+WIN+B. I had to rearrange the display positions after this (1,2,3 to 2,1,3 in my case).  1=Internal display, 2,3=P27qPut my machine to sleep and waited for the monitors to go into standby.Woke the machine and the result was somehow a little better. Not as many windows had moved and resized. Progress. Tested this a couple of times and it somewhat improved results from before the registry change.Second attempt.Renamed the key (again) above and one more key, the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\GraphicsDrivers\Connectivity. Reset of the graphic subsystem SHIFT+CTRL+WIN+B again.Same test as above. To standbys and wake ups a couple of times. This was yesterday.And since then, my windows have kept their size and position throughout standbys and coming back.Don't currently have any other system which I can test this on. So results may certainly vary for others.Brgs,---ORI have found a work-around.Using Sysinternals ProcessMonitor I found that Windows was accessing the following Registry path;HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\GraphicsDrivers\ConfigurationMy system had three entries;DELF003YY7707BR0MUL_30_07D7_6A^9A3774EB79DEE3E3E38496CC7DF4D936QHD32000001_31_07D6_D5^63E1ABDD175E7871DCAEB710418A0F75SIMULATED_8086_2A42_00000000_00020000_1010100^CDE365D1B3F0942F0CF38BFB8E127AB4Under each is a tree called "00" two of the keys arePrimSurfSize.cxPrimSurfSize.cyUnder "00" was another branch also called "00" two of the keys are;ActiveSize.cxActiveSize.cyThe first two of the configs (ie DELF00... & QHD3...) the above keys were 1440x900,so they were not involved.The third (SIMULATED...) were set to 1024x768.I changed these to 1600x900 and the problem was solved.Further I changed resolution (via control panel) to 1920x1080, the moving/resize issue returned,but the lower right corner was set to 1600x900, ie the SIMULATED... settings.So for some reason one of the configs does not get set correctly.I don't know why there are three configs, I have only ever used one monitor.Hope this helps someone out there... -----OR Hello,I think I may have a solution for this problem.  It appears Windows 10 keeps a history of all the monitors it encounters during its life time.  This includes the basic monitor support during the OS install.  So, if you enable "Show hidden devices" in the Device Manager you will see all the monitors that were connected to your system.Start the Control Panel as Administrator:1.  Start Control Panel --> Device Manager2.  Select View --> Show hidden devices3.  Expand Computer --> MonitorsWhen you expand the Monitors you will see your current monitor (highlighted) and all the disconnected monitors (greyed out).   You may see monitors with "non-PNP" and "PNP" listed as well.  I believe these are aliases to your current monitor (at a lower resolution) before Windows installed drivers for it.   I uninstalled ALL the greyed out monitors.  Right-click on these monitors and select uninstall.  Keep only the highlighted monitor you are currently using.  4.  Uninstall all greyed out monitors (even non-PNP and PNP monitors)5.  Reboot your system.After doing this my windows don't resize after my monitor goes to sleep.  You can quickly test this by temporarily setting your monitor sleep time to 1 minute.Settings --> System --> Power & Sleep --> Screen [1 minute]Cheers,Stephen
