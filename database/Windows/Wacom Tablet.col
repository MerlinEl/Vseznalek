How to get rid of those annoying circles from your wacom cursor in Windows 7 Circle 1This is the really annoying circle that appears not when you click but when you hold or drag your pen (it momentarily pauses your cursor, making smooth brushstrokes all but impossible).

To get rid of it:This fix should work on both Windows 7 and Windows 10    Press the windows key    type "pen and touch" and press enter    In the window that appears, left-click the entry "Press and hold" and click "settings".    Uncheck "Enable press and hold for right-clicking".    Click OK on both windows to close themCircle 2This is the little ripple-like circle that appears whenever you click your pen. It doesn't hinder your drawing/painting as severely as the other circle does, but it's still distracting. To get rid of it:Windows 7 solution:    If you don't have a mouse plugged in, you might want to do the final step first    Press the windows key    type "computer management" and press enter    In the window that opens, Double click "Services and Applications" in the centre column    Double click "Services" in the centre column    Scroll down and double click "Tablet PC Input Service"    Find the "Startup type:" dropdown box and change it to "Disabled".    Click OK, then close the Computer Management window    Restart your PC    After your PC loads up again, one of two things should happen: either your tablet works happily and circle-free, or it doesn't work at all. If it doesn't work at all, you now need to download and install the proper driver for it (to replace the Microsoft one that you just disabled).
