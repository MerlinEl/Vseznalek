if keyboard.escPressed do exit usage inside the loop or just for i = 1 to ...while NOT keyboard.escPressed do .... this condition is checked only at the start of each iteration so it only makes sense to hold the escape key at that time...if (keyboard.escPressed) do ( throw "ESCAPE PRESSED" )while x < y do(local delta = x - yif delta <= 0 then exit -- time to bail$foo.pos.x = compute_x (foo / delta)x += 0.1)
