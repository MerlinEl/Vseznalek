player.setMetadata(arg0, arg1);player.getMetadata(str);Spawn Lightning Bolt Where Player is LookingThe code below allows any player with a fishing rod to create a lightning strike by clicking (and aiming somewhere). It's a simple and funny trick.@EventHandlerpublic void onPlayerInteractBlock(PlayerInteractEvent event) {    Player player = event.getPlayer();    if (player.getItemInHand().getType() == Material.FISHING_ROD) {        // Creates a bolt of lightning at a given location. In this case, that location is where the player is looking.        // Can only create lightning up to 200 blocks away.        player.getWorld().strikeLightning(player.getTargetBlock((Set<Material>) null, 200).getLocation());    }}
