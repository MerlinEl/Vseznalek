The following is added to my autorun.cfgYou can simply call TCFS2 once though: ShellExec /T /W:5000 "%COMMANDER_PATH%\plugins\TCFS2\TCFS2.exe" "/ea mm0 fs2"Or just add mm0 to fs action in TCSF2.ini: fs=c0 db0 dc0 cd0 th0 sb0 cl0 kb0 mm0So, to summarize, for your current autorun parameters and for avoiding undesired taskbar behaviour, it should be enough to just call TCFS2 once from Autorun.cfg with following command line (and w/o any TCFS2.ini modifications): ShellExec /T /W:5000 "%COMMANDER_PATH%\Addons\TCFS2\TCFS2.exe" '/ei c0 mm0 /ef "move(-4, -4, cxWorkArea + 8, cyWorkArea + 8)"'
