Enter it, and unpack content of adbplugin.zip there (this is from Android ADB download you did before). After that in Total Commander open Configuration>Options>Plugins then click on Configure beside F"ile system plugins (.WFX)." Then click on "Add", and browse to your "Plugin" folder. There will be two files: ADBPlugin.wfx (x86 version) and ADBPlugin.wfx64 (x64 version). Choose one that is same with version of Total Commander that you installed. Hit "Open". In next window hit "Ok". Go out of Configuration. And you are done. Now we will run it.Go to this dropdown menu from image and select Network Neighborhood, then duble click on ADB. If your phone is recognized there will be another "Folder" with Android icon and some numbers and letters. Double click on that too. And you entered your phone.Some notices:1.
